## How is Haptic governed?

We use a governance model composed by a DAO, community members, early contributors and several councils elected by stakers in the protocol. Each council controls specific parts of the system, for example, the technical council manages the protocol updates multisig, while the Treasury council funds incentives and manages Treasury.

## Haptic improvement proposal
A Haptic improvement proposal or HIP, is a formal request to change some current protocol mechanism or add a new feature. It must be redacted following a set of requirements which are listed on the [HIPs website](https://hips.haptic.finance) and on the relevant [Github repo](https://github.com/HapticFinance/HIPs).
