## HAP backed debt

Debt on the Haptic protocol is backed by HAP tokens. Stakers lock HAP as collateral using our user interface and mint a desired amount of tokenized debt asset (TDA). TDA is currently backed by a 400% c-ratio. This may change in the future, as determined by the community via decentralized governance mechanisms. The c-ratio guarantees that the value of the collateral deposited in enough to absorb most price shocks, without incurring in liquidation risk. Stakers' debt fluctuates as a result of impermanent loss action and borrowers' actions. When a staker wants to exit their position and withdraw HAP collateral, they must pay back their original debt plus any surplus by burning TDA.

## Why staking

Stakers represent the debt pool backing and as such they are central to the system. For this role, they are rewarded with: 

 1. Weekly inflationary supply  
 2. Extra yields generated by the treasury
 3. Protocol fees.

Every week, a large part of the inflationary supply minted is distributed to stakers as a reward. The treasury is able to generate extra yield from LP tokens obtained via the LP bonding process and redirect them to stakers, along with protocol fees.
