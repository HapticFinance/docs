## HAP backed debt

Debt on the Haptic protocol is backed by HAP tokens. Stakers lock HAP as collateral using our user interface and mint an amount of tokenized debt asset (TDA). TDA is currently backed by a 400% c-ratio. This may change in the future, as determined by the community via decentralized governance mechanisms. The c-ratio guarantees that the value of the collateral deposited in enough to absorb most price shocks, without incurring in liquidation risk. Stakers' debt fluctuates as a result of impermanent loss action and decisions of the borrowers. When a staker wants to exit their position and withdraw HAP collateral, they must pay back their debt by burning TDA.

## Why staking

Stakers are the debt pooled counterparts and as such they are central to the system. For this role, the protocol rewards them with: 

- Weekly inflationary supply 
- Extra yields generated by the treasury
- Protocol fees.

Every week, a large part of the inflationary supply minted is distributed to stakers as a reward. The protocol is able to generate extra yield from LP tokens obtained via the LP bonding process and redirect them to stakers. In addition, protocol fees are also entirely netted by stakers.
