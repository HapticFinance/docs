### What is Haptic?

The haptic protocol is a system of smart contracts designed to **increase capital efficiency and to reduce the impact of impermanent loss**. Stakers lock Haptic network token (HAP) as a collateral, enabling the issuance of tokenized debt (TDA). The pooled collateral model enables deep liquidity and eliminates the need for counterparts. Borrowers lock ETH to obtain a stablecoin denominated loan from a third party procotol and the funds are used to provide liquidity on a external automated market maker platform. The protocol tracks impermanent loss and provides compensation to honest borrowers along with the exchange fees generated by their liquidity. Stakers are rewarded for their role with staking rewards and yields generated by the treasury. The system is built around composability principles and leverages existing protocols to achieve its functionality.

### Overview

Haptic is a dual token system, comprised of Haptic network token (HAP) and Tokenized Debt Asset (TDA). All TDA is backed by HAP tokens, with a collateralisation ratio of 400%. Stakers incur in debt when they mint TDA, and they must pay it back before exiting the system. Stakers are incentivized to stake their HAP tokens in several ways. Firstly, if their account is in optimal health, they are entitled to a portion of the protocol's weekly inflationary supply. In addition, they will receive extra yields generated by the treasury. Borrowers deposit ETH and obtain a stablecoin denominated loan choosing from a supported protocol and desired collateralisation ratio.
