### Automated market maker (AMM)
A decentralized protocol designed to eliminate the need for counterparties and automate token trades.

### Liquidity provider (LP)
A person or entity that engages in liquidity provisioning on AMMs such as Uniswap, Sushiswap, etc.

### LP token 
A token representing a share in the liquidity of an AMM pool

### Impermanent loss (I/L)

Refers to the loss experienced by liquidity providers on AMMs due to the effect of arbitrage trades and market volatility, also known as divergence loss.

### Protocol owned liquidity (POL)
Refers to the ability of the protocol to control its own liquidity on AMMs, as a result of the LP Bonding process.

### Tokenized debt asset (TDA)
Staking in the Haptic protocol creates debt, which is represented by the tokenized debt asset, which is pegged 1:1 with the US Dollar.

### Collateralisation ratio (c-ratio)
It represents the value of the collateral against the loaned funds.

### LP Bonding
Bonding is when a staker purchases HAP tokens from the protocol, at a discount from the market price. The staker provides another asset (a stable coin, LP token, or Ethereum) to the protocol treasury in return for the HAP token. Discount is determined by the market and depends on the balance between demand and supply of the tokenized debt asset.
