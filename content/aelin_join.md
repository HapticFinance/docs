(*) We recommend MetaMask, but here is a [full list](https://www.optimism.io/apps/wallets) of wallet compatible with Optimism.


Once you have found the Haptic Pool, review all the details related to the Pool and ask any questions you have in the [Community Discord](https://discord.gg/ahJVRvjyzk). If you are on board with the proposed terms, you can choose the amount of sUSD you want to purchase/contribute to this Pool.

You can connect your web3 wallet by finding the "Connect" button at the top right corner of the Aelin screen. You'll be prompted to pick your wallet and approve a prompt allowing access to communicate with your wallet.
