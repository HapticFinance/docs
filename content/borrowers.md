### What are the benefits?
Haptic finance aims to be a comprehensive on-ramp for the average DeFi user who seeks to engage in liquidity provisioning and yield farming activities. Our ethos is to empower users and their decision making by providing them with context and awareness. As such, Haptic offers real-time tracking of impermanent loss coupled with detailed LP stats and our user interface is designed to guide and reward users for optimal behavior.

### How does it work?

Borrowers engage with Haptic by depositing ETH and selecting one of the available protocols as the loan provider. E.g., if they choose Synthetix, they will receive sUSD, with a 150% C-ratio. If ETH/USD is $3000, this means that by depositing 1 ETH, they can mint roughly 2000 sUSD. In addition, the loan is subject to an interest rate*. The next step is selecting the desired liquidity pool. Initially, we will support only Uniswap, but this will change in the future. Once a choice is made, the protocol will execute the token swaps(s) and add liquidity onto the pool. As a result, the borrower is engaged in LP provisioning and impermanent loss starts being tracked, together with any earnings from exchange fees generated by his position. From this time on, the borrower must keep his account in check, in order to benefit from impermanent loss compensation and avoid liquidation. 

### Loan health

In the above example, if ETH/USD takes a sharp downturn and the underlying loan c-ratio falls below liquidation ratio\*, the loan becomes at risk of being liquidated. Under such circumstance, the protocol may partially sell the ETH deposited in order to pay back the outstanding loan, plus a liquidation fee\*. As a result of a partial liquidation, the account c-ratio is restored. In this scenario, the user could avoid being impacted by either depositing more collateral or reducing his LP position.

 
### I/L compensation

Borrowers can decide at any time to exit their position and withdraw the ETH deposited. Upon such action, liquidity is withdrawn and the outstanding loan is paid back, including any interest. Under normal market conditions, the protocol will calculate any impermanent loss and disburse compensation denominated in TDA. Borrower can choose to automatically swap TDA for the loaned token and withdraw their principal plus profit. During heavy market volatility, the protocol will offer rewards in change for the user locking the liquidity position for a certain amount of time, e.g. 30 days. Rewards offered will range from tokens to exclusive NFTs.
