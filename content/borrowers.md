### Increase capital efficiency and reduce the impact of impermanent loss.

The haptic protocol is a system of smart contracts designed to increase capital efficiency and to reduce the impact of impermanent loss. Stakers lock Haptic network token (HAP) as a collateral, enabling the issuance of US dollar denominated debt. This pooled collateral model enables deep liquidity and eliminates the need for counterparts. Borrowers lock ETH collateral to obtain a stablecoin denominated loan from a third party procotol and the funds are used to provide liquidity on a external automated market maker platform. The protocol tracks impermanent loss and provides compensation to honest borrowers along with the majority of token swap fees generated by their liquidity. Stakers are rewarded for their role with staking rewards and a portion of the token swap fees. The system is built around composability principles and leverages existing protocols to achieve its functionality.
